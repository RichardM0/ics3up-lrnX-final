# ics3up-lrnX-final
Project for ICS3UP involving developing a website of your choice. I chose to develop a courses website, which focuses on Computer Science. Here I have many subfolders.
These subfolders include the Subjects for Courses, certain CSS files, and other things to keep my files organized, neat, and easy to navigate.
